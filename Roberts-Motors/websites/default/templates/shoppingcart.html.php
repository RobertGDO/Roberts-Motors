        <div id="Introduction">
            <p>At the beginning of this project, I was so worried to change something as I thought if I did it might
                ruin the whole website and so I never used to delete anything only commented things out. Finally towards
                the end of the project I had realised branches were exactly what I was missing and eventually I deleted
                code I did not need anymore.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="Middle">
            <p>I turned auto saver on for visual studio initially as it prevents data loss but soon realised this was
                not good as it is time consuming and harder to recover unwanted changes. I used a specific colour scheme
                which made the website look bold, consistent, clear and professional. I also changed the main grid only
                on portfolio and site report webpages as the aside was just a blank space which was not needed.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="Middle2">
            <p>Took me a long time to find how to get rid or add margin/padding spaces until I learnt how to use
                inspect. I particularly like when I hover over sections in the html, it highlights them on the page so I
                know exactly how to grid is laid out. Also shows quick changes in CSS code without making them permanent
                like branches except with the terminal at the side of the webpage with direct implementation.</p>
        </div>

            <p>Overall, with my experience in this project, I found this project took a lot of patience and, trial and
                error but was fun. I had made sure to add many comments so that when I had come back to do some more
                work, I knew exactly where I had left incomplete code to continue with later.</p>
