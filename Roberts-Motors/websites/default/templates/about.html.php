                I decided to use a two-column grid template for all the pages on my website,I wanted an exciting colour
                and not something boring and dull to look at first I went for a purple palette with dark purple as the
                background colour at first it looked nice but the more I viewed it the uglier it looked so I used a
                website called coolors and it generated a warm, attention-grabbing template that will not only be
                calming to viewer but also exciting to see Â https://coolors.co/u/fox_willow for fonts I used google
                fonts https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Code+Pro and choose the source code pro because it felt
                interactive
